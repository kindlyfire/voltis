# Voltis

Voltis is a self-hosted media servers that supports comics/manga and ebooks. It
will support series, movies, and YouTube video libraries in the future as well.
I built it specifically to suit my needs. It is opinionated and may not work for
your needs.

## Project Moved

I've moved this project to a personal Forgejo instance. You can find it here: [tijlvdb/voltis](https://git.tijlvdb.me/tijlvdb/voltis).

The containers are still hosted by GitHub: [ghcr.io/kindlyfire/voltis](https://github.com/kindlyfire/voltis/pkgs/container/voltis)
